## Projects

🥳 Ask Out Project

Description:
This fun and interactive project was created to add a bit of humor and creativity to asking someone out. It features two buttons: "Yes" and "No". The twist is that the "No" button is unclickable, while the "Yes" button grows larger when you try to hover over the "No" button, making it the inevitable choice. Upon clicking "Yes", the user is redirected to a page where they can arrange a date.

Features:

Interactive UI: Two buttons with a playful behavior to make the interaction fun.
Unclickable 'No' Button: Adds a humorous twist by making the "No" button unresponsive.
Growing 'Yes' Button: The "Yes" button increases in size when the user attempts to hover over the "No" button, drawing attention.
Redirection on Confirmation: Clicking "Yes" redirects to a new page to arrange a date.
Technologies Used:

HTML for the structure of the pages.
CSS for styling and enhancing the user experience.
JavaScript for adding dynamic behavior to the buttons.
